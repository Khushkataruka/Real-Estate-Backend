# Real Estate Price Prediction

## Description
This project predicts real estate prices based on user-provided input features, such as location, size, and number of rooms. It integrates a machine learning model with an interactive frontend for a seamless user experience.

## Key Features
- *Interactive Frontend*: Built with React, the frontend allows users to input property details easily.
- *Machine Learning Model*: A trained model (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest) predicts property prices based on historical data.
- *Real-Time Predictions*: The frontend sends user inputs to the backend and displays the predicted price instantly.
- *User-Friendly Interface*: Designed to ensure a smooth and intuitive experience for users.

## Frontend
- Collects user inputs, such as:
  - Location
  - Area (in square feet)
  - Number of bedrooms, bathrooms, etc.
  - Additional amenities
- Sends data to the backend via an API call.

## Backend
- Processes input data.
- Passes the data to the trained machine learning model.
- Returns the predicted price to the frontend.

## Output
- Displays the predicted price in a clear and visually appealing format.
- Optionally includes visualizations or insights, such as price trends for a given location.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed for the frontend.
- Python installed for the backend and machine learning model.
- Dependencies listed in requirements.txt (for the backend) and package.json (for the frontend).

### Backend Setup
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   bash
   cd backend
   
2. Install dependencies:
   bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
3. Train the model (if not pre-trained):
   bash
   python train_model.py
   
4. Start the backend server:
   bash
   python app.py
   

### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   bash
   cd frontend
